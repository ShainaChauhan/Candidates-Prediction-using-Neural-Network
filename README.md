# Candidates-Prediction-using-Neural-Network

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis of a dataset from Alphabet Soup, a charitable organization. The analysis aims to predict which organizations are most likely to succeed in their funding applications based on historical data. This project utilizes machine learning models, particularly neural networks, to conduct the analysis and provide insights into the factors influencing funding application success.
